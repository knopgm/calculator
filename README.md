# Mini - Project - Calculator

Thanks for checking out the repo of this mini project.

As a beginner, it was a very challenging project, with lots of logical conditions to properly handle the results of a real calculator.
In the majority, I've used my knowledge from Javascript conditions and functions, but I'm still slowly changing my code to React, with their hooks and reusable components.
